Subject: [PATCH 17/21] PM: fix might_sleep_if in __pm_runtime_idle

commit b1d0d5f ("PM: runtime: add might_sleep to PM runtime functions")
added might_sleep_if() checks for __pm_runtime_* functions. But while
__pm_runtime_suspend/resume checked dev->power.irq_safe (which allows
using these functions in atomic context), __pm_runtime_idle missed
that check.

[Note that this bug doesn't exist in the upstreamed commit (311aab7
"PM / Runtime: Add might_sleep() to runtime PM functions")]
